A Python implementation of Polypharmacology pipeline to generate a dataset of reference ligands (see Example/dataset.pdf), perform in silico target fishing on the dataset, identify similar compounds between 2 or more targets in the dataset etc. 

Usage: python PolyPharm.py

Required Packages: 
	1) BLAST
	2) OpenBabel
	3) RDKit

	Also load py_packages when running on minerva.

TO DO:
1) Add circular fingerprint support to "Find compounds for my target(s)".
