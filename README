A Python implementation of Polypharmacology pipeline (see https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1758-2946-6-33) to generate a dataset of reference ligands, perform in silico target fishing on the dataset, identify similar compounds between two or more targets in the dataset etc. 

Example folder provides a test case-study demonstrating polypharmacology in Kinases, and also provides the reference target dataset used. 

Usage: python PolyPharm.py

Required Packages: 
	1) Python2
	2) BLAST
	2) OpenBabel
	3) RDKit
